Better Steam Overlay Replacement is a GMod mod, whose task is to try to replicate the functionality of the missing steam overlay on the x86-64 chromium beta version of Garry's Mod.

## This Mod Features -
- Browser Functionality
  - Guides Widget (Just a browser with GMod guides tab opened, same as steam overlay one)
  - Browser (Just a basic gmod DBrowser)
  - Miniature (Mini version of the browser without url top-bar, that opens currently running page in the default browser.)
- Notes (Just a simple DTextEntry for now. CHECK: TODO LIST)
- Game Overview (Not too much info, for now)
